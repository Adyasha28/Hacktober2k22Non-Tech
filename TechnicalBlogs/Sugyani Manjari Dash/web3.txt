Web3 – the latest internet iteration – is a decentralized online network built and established through the blockchain.With Web3, there's no central authority or governing bodies controlling the platforms or apps. Put another way, corporations aren't collecting, hoarding, and monetizing the data of a user who wants to participate in a Web3 service or app. Users can instead engage and interact on Web3 platforms without exchanging their data for access. Additionally, complete transparency and trust are built into the services, with all data and updates stored on the blockchain.
More on what makes Web3 different:
Web3 is ushering in an entirely new way people participate on the internet. There are many surface-level differences plus more nuanced distinctions compared to the previous versions of the internet.

Still, one of the main reasons for this revolutionary shift to Web3 is building a new internet that focuses on decentralization. It's here where the different forms of the web start to branch out and where Web3 can potentially change the structure of the internet.

Where will Web3 take us?
While Web3 has been instrumental in developing NFTs, the metaverse, and even cryptocurrencies, it's still hard to determine how far this new phase of the internet can go.

For others, NFTs, the metaverse, and even cryptocurrencies are just a fraction of what can be achieved with the vast amount of energy and resources dedicated to developing this next phase of the internet.

What is guaranteed is that energy and resources will continue to pour into developing Web3 technologies. You can bet your favorite NFT that significant advancements are right around the corner.
